# Don't cha wish your ggplot has colours like me?
**By Liza Bolton**

*This talk was given on 2019-06-12, at Xero, Auckland for an R Ladies Meetup.*

This 5-minute talk aims to introduce people to some cool colour palettes for use in R.
You can view the slides on [my website](https://www.dataembassy.co.nz/Liza-colours-in-R#1). 

This folder has all the code that went into making the slides, incase you like anything you see.

Thanks to Jacquie Tran [@jacquietran](https://twitter.com/jacquietran) for inspiring me to make Xaringan slides, and of course Yihui for [the package](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), and [R Ladies Auckland](https://twitter.com/RLadiesAKL) for creating this opportunity.

You're welcome to get in touch with me - [@Liza_Bolton](https://twitter.com/Liza_Bolton).
